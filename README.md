# Monty-Hall-3-Door-Puzzle
The Monty Hall puzzle confuses many people including myself, which is why I found it useful to create a simulation to prove the result.

First of all, there are in fact 3 different choices you can make, not just switch or don't.
1) Switch to the other door
2) Don't Switch and keep your first choice
3) Choose randomly between the last 2 doors

Many people believe that switching makes no difference, because when there are only 2 doors left it is a 50-50 chance. That would be true only if you then chose between the last 2 doors randomly, as you can see in the demonstration script. Choosing randomly between the last 2 doors and not switching is NOT the same thing.

#### Switching gives you a 66.6% chance of winning.

#### Sticking to your first choice gives you a 33.3% chance of winning.

#### Choosing randomly between the last 2 doors gives a 50% chance of winning.
